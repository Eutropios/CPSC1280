    a.
        If one enters a valid IP when prompted by the script, the script sends 2 echo requests to the IP address.
        It then receives the ping (or time taken for a message to be sent round trip to and from the IP address).
        It also displays information regarding the number of packets transmitted (in this case 2, because of the 2 echo
        requests), as well as the information about packet loss, and other relavant information.
    
    b.
        The script simply returns "server dead" when an invalid IP address is passed as an argument.
    
    c.
        The file "err" gets created regardless of there being an instance of an error. When an invalid IP does get passed
        to the script, the file contains the message:
            "ping: abc: Name or service not known
            
            "
        The message takes up two lines. one of which being empty.
